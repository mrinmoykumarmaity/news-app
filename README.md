# news-app
*"I built a simple News Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app fetches live articles from NewsAPI and displays them in a clean, responsive grid layout. It also includes a search feature to filter articles by keywords. This project helped me practice working with APIs, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and building user-friendly UIs.
